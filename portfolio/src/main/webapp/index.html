        <p>Hello! My name is Enrique Aviña, I am a rising junior studying computer science at MIT and I'm very interested in robotics, simulation, and public policy. I'm originally from Redwood City, California and have a twin brother (although we don't look all that alike). I love soccer, and have played on a team since I was 7, and love FIFA too!

    <div class="section" id="projects">
         <h1>Projects</h1>
         <p>Please enjoy these projects from my (very) outdated <a href="http://rickyavina.com/index.html#projects">personal website</a></p>
         <p>I am currently very interested in machine learning, and reinforcement learning in particular. I'd love to highlight one project.
             My freshman year, I worked with MIT's Aerospace Controls Laboratory to create an augmented reality platform for testing pedestrian-vehicle interactions". The
             repository can be found <a href="https://github.com/RickyAvina/Hololens">here</a>. Essentially, pedestrians are rendered as 
             holograms, and a real car tries to drive around them; the information is recorded and used to train RL algorithms. Below is a gif of
             the space mapping capabilities of the Microsoft Hololens, the headset/AR platform used in this project. </p>
             <img src="images/holo.gif"/>
        </br></br>
        <p>I am currently trying to learn about investing and working on a <a href="https://gym.openai.com/">Gym</a> RL environment to derive short-term and long-term investment policies.
        I am also trying to learn more about multi-agent RL systems!</p>

    <div class="section" id="interests">
        <h1>Interests</h1>
        <div id="gallery"></div>
        <p>I love soccer! I've been playing since I was 7, although I only play for fun now occasionally. My twin brother and I have always been on the same team and is our 
            favorite activity. I also love to play FIFA, the video game and am willing to play at any time.
